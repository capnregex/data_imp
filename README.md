# Data Imp Porter

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'data_imp'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install data_imp

## Usage

The use of this gem requires that you define an 'importer' for your files. 

the fields from your data will be available to the importer as if they were local variables. 
```ruby
class SampleImporter < DataImp::Porter
  def import
    User.create_with(
      name: name,
    ).find_or_create_by(
      email: email
    )
  end
end
```

If you had your users in a csv file like

```csv
name,email
George,george@example.com
Fred,fred@example.net
```

You could then use
```ruby
DataImp.import 'user.csv'
```

If you had your users in a yaml file like

```yaml
---
- name: George
  email: george@example.com
- name: Fred
  email: fred@example.net
```

You could then use
```ruby
DataImp.import 'user.yaml'
```

The same importer would be used for either example. 

The importer is looked up by the base name, or provided by the `importer:` parameter. . 'user' in this case. 

Parsing of the file is done by a Parser class and is looked up by the file extension, or the `parser:` parameter. 

Pre defined parsers are located in the lib/data_imp/parsers/ folder

If you need to write your own, define it as 'class ExtParser < DataImp::Parser' to create or override the 'ext' extension parser.
